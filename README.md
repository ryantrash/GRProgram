## Background
This project is a "mock submission" to the Hack The Track hackathon hosted by Gazoo Racing Toyota. I created this project
to experiment with data science with python and pandas and to enhance my skills. 

## Functionality 
Given the telemetry data for different vehicles, the project is intended to compare a selected vehicle's telemetry with 
the lap leader and determine areas for improvement. This is mainly intended as a post-race driver training tool, outlining
sometimes unoticable differences which, compounded, create lag times in the driver's times. The belief is that, by 
highlighting these differences, drivers can improve their time and be more competitive in races.
